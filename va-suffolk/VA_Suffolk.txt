NOTES										
 - Population and housing findings are based on population and housing on land below stated										
elevation thresholds, and do not make adjustments for multistory housing										
 - Land percentages based upon total city area after applying land definition filters										
used in this study, not upon total area reported by Census										
 - "Total land" includes freshwater wetland areas as demarked by the National Wetlands Inventory;										
"dry land" does not.
